The purpose of decbilling is to:

1. Generate a web page to tell the DEC secretaries what was done in the procedure room and collect data for the programmatic generation of accounts for anaesthetists - docbill_start.py
2. Notify secretarial staff that a procedure has been done and automatically fill that data into the day surgery module - watcher.py
3. Print accounts - decbatches.py
4. Provide a simple analysis package to tell jrt how many patients he needs to do to reach a target - jt_target.py
